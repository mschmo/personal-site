title: Hello World
date: 2014-09-26
tags: [intro, frozen flask]

So I guess it is a tradition to start with a hello world post. For this blog I've just started playing with [Frozen Flask](http://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/). It allows me to easily generate static content such as this page and serving through an easy to write/read Markdown file. And for anyone interested in the styling of this site, I am using [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/).

You can view the source of this entire website [here](https://github.com/mschmo/personal-site). Hopefully I don't accidentally push any secure content there...

The posts that I intend to write here will typically involve some kind of data analysis on various subjects, although my main areas of interest include biology, music and sports. Please stay tuned!
